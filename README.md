## Hi, I’m Alex 👋

I’m a student at the University of Wisconsin–Madison studying **Information Science and Data Science**, with a focus on **IT, systems administration, and infrastructure**. I enjoy building and maintaining systems that actually run things — servers, networks, monitoring, and automation.

---

### 🔧 What I’m working on
- 🖥️ **Calypso** — a personal Ubuntu server for learning Linux, Docker, networking, and monitoring
- 🐳 Containerized services with **Docker & Docker Compose**
- 🌐 Self-hosted services accessed securely via **Tailscale**
- 📊 Exploring **Prometheus, Grafana, and Netdata** for system and network monitoring
- 🤖 **Taco beaver Bot** — a private Discord bot project

---

### 🌱 What I’m learning
- Linux system internals & service management (systemd, networking, firewalls)
- Container networking, port publishing, and reverse proxies
- Monitoring, logging, and observability
- Secure remote access and zero-trust networking concepts

---

### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu), Windows
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Docker Compose, NGINX, Traefik
- **Networking:** TCP/IP, NAT/PAT, firewalls (UFW), Tailscale
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C, JavaScript, Bash
- **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana, Netdata
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

### 📁 Projects
Some projects here are public, others are private or infrastructure-based and documented instead of shared directly.  
If something is marked private, I’m always happy to talk about the design and decisions behind it.
